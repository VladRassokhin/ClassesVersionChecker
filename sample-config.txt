; each line represent a patching rule
;

;     this is exclude rule. It excludes all paths that starts with given prefix,
;     longer path include rule overcomes exclude rule
;  xx => path
;     this is the rule to check that java classes under given path of version xx or older, where xx could

;  check static => path
;     this is the rule to check static class usages in classes under given path
;  - check static => path
;     exclude following paths from the check
;  allow static class NAME
;     allow use of given class (by starts-with) from static context
;  include path
;     include content of path (it is relative to the parent directory of current config file) into this file

;  all paths are relative to scan folder
;
;  exclude rules are checked first
;  longest rule wins
;
;  '*' can be used to denote any directory

;  have fun
